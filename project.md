<h1 class="desc">Description</h1>
<p class="chapo">This research project is part of the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding signed in March 2018 between the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Director General of the French Development Agency. This memorandum, which covers various topics related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, has as a priority goal the study of the various dimensions of climate damage in Viet Nam and the assessment of adaptation strategies. The present project is the main concretization of this, materialized in a new Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 2019. In addition, this project provides significant support to Vietnamese research and the production of high-level research results that will support the public policy dialogue of the Agence Française de Développement with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.</p><span class="dots"></span>
	<div class="more" style="display: none;">
		<h1>Context</h1>
		<h2>Viet Nam and climate change</h2>
		<p class="longtext_bold ">Viet Nam has made a determined commitment to develop a sustainable economy in line with the goals set at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris in 2015.</p>
		<p class="longtext">For example, Viet Nam submitted its National Contribution (NCDP/iNDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in September 2015, setting the unconditional target of reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) by 8% compared to the baseline scenario, which could be increased to 25% with foreign aid. Vietnam signed the Paris Accord in April 2016 in New York and ratified it in November 2016. The Vietnamese government has finally approved the implementation plan of the Paris Climate Agreement in Vietnam. (QD2053/QĐ-TTg of 28 October 2016)  </p>
		<p class="longtext">Viet Nam's commitment on climate issues is not recent. The Vietnamese government promulgated the National Climate Change Strategy in 2011 and the National Green Growth Strategy and Action Plans in 2012. These two national strategies are steered and coordinated by the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC), which is chaired by the Prime Minister, and whose Secretariat, the department responsible for assisting the NCCC, is provided by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE).  </p>
		<p class="longtext "><b>Viet Nam is indeed a country particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change: </b>rising sea levels, soil erosion, rising temperatures, extreme weather events (drought, floods).  The country comprises two immense deltas, veritable rice granaries of the subcontinent, more than 3200 kilometres of coastline, some of which are already subject to accelerated erosion, and an increase in temperature compared to pre-industrial times already exceeding 2°C in some places. The Mekong Delta, one of the 3 most vulnerable deltas in the world along with the Nile (Egypt) and Ganges-Brahmaputra (Bangladesh), in particular, is already the subject of a strategic plan by the Vietnamese government. The studies on climate impacts in Viet Nam thus reinforce and refine this political will.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">Controlling climate change is the subject of Resolution 24/NQ-TW of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Viet Nam in 2013 on responding to climate change, strengthening natural resource management and environmental protection. This action is also incorporated in the Government Resolution 63/NQ-CP of 2016 on the publication of the Government Action Plan in implementation of the National Assembly Resolution on the Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan of the country for the period 2016-2020. The Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam marked in 2017, through Resolution 120/NQ-CP on the sustainable development of the Mekong Delta in response to climate change, his willingness to respond to the urgency of climate damage particularly affecting the key economic region of the Mekong Delta by preparing an integrated adaptation strategy in the region. </p>
		<h2>AFD and its strategies in Vietnam </h2>
		<p class="longtext_bold ">AFD, a French State public establishment and financing company, is a stakeholder in France's official development assistance mechanism. It has gradually oriented its aid and cooperation mechanism towards financing climate change mitigation and/or adaptation policies and projects and has become one of the leading international donors with the objective of becoming a "100% Paris Agreement".  </p>
		<p class="longtext">For AFD, supporting the national climate change and green growth policy is a strategic priority for its operations in Vietnam. In this framework, AFD has been supporting Vietnam for many years in the design, development and implementation of a development strategy that is low in GHG emissions, conserves natural resources and is resilient to the adverse effects of climate change. In this respect, AFD wishes to continue supporting Vietnam in preventing and adapting to the consequences of natural disasters. Over the 2006-2017 period, EUR 717M of financing has been allocated to Vietnam to finance 22 development projects and programs to combat climate change or adapt to its effects.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">The agency is also one of the first development partners contributing to the public policy dialogue with the Vietnamese authorities within the Support Program in Response to Climate Change (SPRCC). AFD also contributes to the organization of seminars and the production of publications on climate and sustainable development issues. The French team has reiterated its interest and availability this year 2018 to support Vietnam in raising the country's ambitions in line with its international commitments. This ambition is formalized in the memorandum of understanding signed between AFD and MONRE in March 2018 on the occasion of the official visit to the Elysée Palace of the Secretary General of the Vietnamese Communist Party.  </p>
		<h2>Need for the VN Gemmes programme</h2>
		<p class="longtext_bold">The role of research in decision support</p>
		<p class="longtext">Faced with the new complexity of today's world, the rise of new technologies and the discovery of new types of immediate or long-term dangers (climate change, epidemics of new diseases, technological risks; terrorism), scientific expertise has become an essential tool for a modern State to help it in its decision-making. The management of this expertise as well as its systematic integration into the decision-making process takes on a completely new importance nowadays.  Scientific research requires autonomy in its objects, its methods and the analysis of its results. There is an ongoing dialogue with the different levels of public decision-making, which can shed crucial light on the difficulties encountered in translating research results into concrete and coherent action. The link between research and public decision-making is therefore the product of reciprocal innervation, with respect for each other's autonomy and roles. The process of drawing up the reports of the International Group of Experts on Climate can serve as a reference in this respect. </p>
		<p class="longtext_bold">Status of research on CC and adaptation strategies in Vietnam</p>
		<p class="longtext">Research on climate change and its impacts in Viet Nam is a particularly active area. Actors range from academic research in economics, anthropology, sociology, climatology, hydrology, ... to non-governmental organisations supporting field initiatives in terms of resilience and adaptation, to government studies from various research institutes placed with Vietnamese ministries or the Vietnamese Academy of Social Sciences, or by donors in the framework of applied research aimed at providing adaptation and resilience services downstream of the studies.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">Nevertheless, there are almost no comprehensive studies on the diversity of socio-economic impacts of climate change in Viet Nam and on possible adaptation pathways. The last relatively similar approach dates back to a study by UNU-Wider and ICES (Arndt et al., 2015), to which the VN Gemmes project proposes to add considerably in terms of economic, social, geographical and discussion of adaptation strategies. The econometric work developed for an estimation of climate damage in the United States (Hsiang et al., 2017) and the inter-disciplinary work proposed by and for the Aquitaine region (Salles and Le Treut, 2017) are the sources of inspiration for the project, beyond the macroeconomic approach specific to the Gemmes programme (Bovari et al., 2018).</p>
		<p class="longtext_bold">History of the Gemmes programme</p>
		<p class="longtext"><b>The GEMMES (GEneralized Monetary Macrodynamics for the Ecological Shift) applied research program, launched by AFD in 2015, aims to facilitate public policy dialogue on climate-related issues and more broadly on ecological transition.</b>It has two main objectives: to participate in and contribute to the international debate on climate (IPCC, COP, ...), and to strengthen capacities to build, manage and assess public climate policies in partner countries. Partnerships have thus been initiated with Brazil (on energy transition scenarios), with Côte d'Ivoire (on the budgetary impact of variations in the price of raw materials) and with Colombia (on the role of natural resources). Each partnership is based on the alliance of an anchor within the country's government bodies at the heart of climate strategy decisions, and within one or more research organisations (or think-tanks). All of them are also part of a capacity building perspective (notably applied research and expertise) and public policy dialogue. </p>
		<h1>Objectives of the VN Gemmes project  </h1>
		<p class="longtext">The VN Gemmes project will use the latest scientific methods in all relevant fields for the analysis of impacts and adaptation strategies, in close cooperation with Vietnamese scientists, Vietnamese public research institutes, selected in coordination with the NCCC via MONRE as its secretariat. The main selection criteria are scientific excellence in the selected fields, the prospects for articulation with the programming of public climate policies and access to the best existing data for each of the project's tasks. The research work will start in the first quarter of 2019, once a dedicated AFD financial vehicle is launched to support analysis, research and decision support efforts on mitigation and adaptation policies in partner countries.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">The VN Gemmes programme is highly complementary to existing projects of other bilateral and multilateral donors and non-governmental organisations. Indeed, many of these are positioned in analyses of Viet Nam's mitigation strategies, such as the Platform 2050 project launched at the initiative of Laurence Tubiana for a set of key countries including Viet Nam. This platform is in the process of concluding a partnership with the MPI on the prospects for long-term low-carbon transition, which will be coordinated with AFD's Gemmes VN project on impacts and adaptation. Bilateral and multilateral donors are for the most part financing direct contributions to the elaboration of public climate policies where the Gemmes VN project is positioned upstream, at a level of addition to existing knowledge. </p>
		<p class="longtext">The results of the Gemmes VN project will feed into the preparation of the different components of Vietnamese climate action by providing upstream technical and scientific notes, the priorities of which will be discussed with the Climate Change Department of MONRE, as permanent secretariat of the NCCC. The VN Gemmes project has a new objective to provide an integrated, open and as comprehensive as possible analytical framework for damage and adaptation issues in Viet Nam. </p>
		<h1>Project components  </h1>
		<p class="longtext">The project is organised around different workpackages (WP). The first six WPs are dedicated to scientific research, research capacity building and the translation of scientific results into policy briefs for each of the themes addressed, for the NCCC. The WP7 is more specifically dedicated to the dissemination and organisation of conferences, seminars and events on impacts and adaptation issues, particularly in the framework of international climate conferences.</p>
		<h1>Beneficiaries of the VN Gemmes project   </h1>
		<h2>Direct beneficiaries of the project</h2>
		<p class="longtext">
		The Gemmes VN project targets two distinct types of direct beneficiaries:
		<ul>
		<li>The National Climate Change Committee (NCCC, including MONRE, MARD, and MPI) </li>
		<li>The Vietnamese climate change scientific research community in Viet Nam. </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p class="longtext">The first beneficiary will have co-ownership of the scientific results, will ensure the transformation of these results into operational public policy recommendations or briefing notes for administrative and political decision-makers, and will be able to promote these results at conferences for the general public or at events during the next Conferences of the Parties.  The second beneficiary has the benefit of funds to conduct scientific research at international level, supported by French research units from CNRS, INRA and IRD. These funds allow the direct financing of researchers, post-doctoral, doctoral and master students, international training, seminars and conferences, field missions as well as the acquisition of research equipment.  </p>
		<h2>Indirect beneficiaries of the project  </h2>
		<p class="longtext">
		Two types of indirect beneficiaries are considered:
		<ul class="longtext">  
		<li>Non-governmental organisations and other relevant services will be able to use the scientific results and the dissemination to a wide public of the effects of climate change to guide and increase their actions on the ground.  </li>
		<li>The general public, particularly in Viet Nam, will have access to comprehensive and qualitative information on possible adaptation strategies to the effects of climate change.  </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h1>Organisation of project implementation  </h1>
		<h2>General structuring of the project  </h2>
		<p class="longtext">
		The GEMMES Vietnam project is structured around 3 circles:
		<ul class="longtext"> 
		<li>an academic circle at the heart of the programme, which will autonomously develop its research (Axes 1 to 6), while using privileged access to public data thanks to the institutional circle and feeding into diagnoses and policy recommendations on the subjects of damage and adaptation.  </li>
		A research committee is composed of the three research co-directors and the leaders of the different WPs to discuss and guide the project on a quarterly basis. Any researcher included in the project or any expert involved in policy ownership can participate upon request of one of the three co-directors. A representative of the institutional committee can participate as an observer.  
		A scientific evaluation committee, external to the project and composed of internationally recognised researchers in the different fields of the project, will propose an analysis of the project's progress, the methods used and the results obtained at the mid-term and at the end of the project.
		<li>an institutional circle then, which will aim to cooperate with the various ministries in charge of climate issues and in particular impact and adaptation issues (present within the NCCC interministerial committee led by the Vietnamese MP, and therefore the permanent secretariat is placed under the Ministry of the Environment - MONRE) and to feed into the diagnosis and recommendations for these ministries (Axis 7). MONRE's Climate Change Department (DCC), ensuring the secretariat tasks of the NCCC, will be the institutional coordinator of this circle. It will work in close collaboration with the central and local authorities involved in the project, facilitate access to data and encourage the public policy dialogue that the project may inspire.  </li>
		A coordination committee will be set up to mobilise experts from the ministries and local authorities involved in the project activities, to facilitate access to data, and to anticipate the needs for effective public policy dialogue (selection of experts for the drafting of policy briefs). This committee will meet at regular intervals of approximately 6 months in wide format, and 3 months in restricted format. 
		The exact composition of the coordination committee belongs to the MoNRE/DCC. It may alternate between :
		<dl>
		<dd> - A minimum format, which will include the GEMMES VN project leader, research co-leaders, relevant research experts, an expert from the NCCC, a representative of the DCC and relevant ministerial expert(s) on the topic on the agenda.  </dd>
		<dd> - A broad format, which will also include regional and thematic representatives from AFD, and higher level representation from the NCCC, DCC and ministerial experts.  </dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Finally, a public circle, which will promote the dissemination of information on the impacts of climate change and possible resilience strategies, while also feeding the diagnosis of researchers and politicians through closer contact with the different currents in society.  </li>
		This public circle, structured as a committee of personalities recognised for their contribution to the dissemination and awareness of environmental and climate issues in Viet Nam and around the world, will be mobilised during dissemination events and on a case-by-case basis after discussion by the research and coordination committees. The composition of the committee is decided jointly by the coordination and research committees.
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Articulation between the research and the NCCC by the coordination committee  </h2>
		<p class="longtext">The Gemmes Vietnam project is a response to a strong political opportunity: the recent declaration of the Vietnamese Prime Minister on the damage suffered by the Mekong Delta, which has prompted the implementation of a strategic plan in which the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MoNRE), the Ministry of Agriculture (MARD) and the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will be strongly involved; the willingness of MONRE, as the permanent office of the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC), to include a damage and adaptation component in the next update report on the implementation of Vietnam's National Contributions submitted in 2021 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); the need for the MPI to better take into account the costs of climate damage on the different types of public investments in the framework of its development of five-year plans, long-term plans and the national adaptation strategy. </p>
		<p class="longtext">In view of the above, the MoNRE, precisely because of its role as the permanent office of the NCCC (via the Department of Climate Change, DCC), has been chosen as the institutional entry point of the project, and privileged partner of the project. This mutual interest must be formalised in a letter of intent.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">The good articulation between the NCCC and the GEMMES VN project is crucial to the success of the project. On the one hand, it will allow to prioritize the research and especially the "policy" notes in accordance with the NCCC agenda; on the other hand, it will facilitate the access to certain data and the coordination of the actors on the project. During the project, and in addition to the joint events that will be organised on a regular basis (conferences, seminars, side-events at COPs), the regular meeting of a coordination committee will discuss the incorporation of the scientific results in the form of public policy briefs in support of the national adaptation plan, the Mekong Delta strategy and the bi-annual report on national contributions by 2021.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">The Platform 2050, launched by Laurence Tubiana to operationalise the objectives of the Paris Agreement, proposes to launch an exercise with Viet Nam (and more specifically the MPI) on the country's long-term low-carbon trajectories. This theme of mitigation and low-carbon trajectories to 2050 is very complementary to the objectives of the GEMMES VN project on impacts and adaptation to 2050. This complementarity could give rise to real coordination, from the organisation of joint or shared events/workshops, to reflection on the harmonisation of the scientific methods used and joint participation in this coordination committee.  </p>
		<h1>Implementation of the project </h1>
		<h2>Financing channels   </h2>
		<p class="longtext">AFD is the project owner: it selects, finances and validates all the services of the different WPs, via research centres as well as individual researchers or experts for the political appropriation of the results. It prepares, coordinates and finances the organization of seminars/conferences, particularly within the framework of the Climate Conferences (COPs) or any other element of dissemination or communication strategy.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">With a view to simplifying administration, the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), which has been present and active for many years in Viet Nam in all fields of applied research, was chosen as a partner to be the project's integrator and to contract with the various Vietnamese research operators and event organisers. AFD will contract within this framework (possibly via a COPAR) with IRD in a direct agreement format.  </p>
		<h2>Partner institutional authority  </h2>
		<p class="longtext">The Vietnamese institutional authority partner of the project is MONRE, via the DCC, as the permanent secretariat of the NCCC. It coordinates the institutional circle through the coordination committee. As such, it is in charge of :  
		<dl class="longtext">
		<dd> - Cooperation with relevant ministries and departments such as MPI, MFA, MARD, State Bank of Vietnam, GSO, etc.  </dd>
		<dd> - the validation at biannual intervals of the experts selected for the integration of the results into Viet Nam's climate strategies and the prioritisation of the research work in relation to the Vietnamese climate agenda.  </dd>
		<dd> - appropriation and dissemination of the project results in the relevant regulatory texts, and submission of the final project results reports to the NCCC and the relevant ministries.  </dd>
		</dl>
		</p>
		<h2>Entities involved in the implementation of the project  </h2>
		<p class="longtext">The entities directly in charge of project implementation are therefore the research and institutional committees. They cooperate and exchange regularly for the smooth running of the project and the articulation between research and institutional dissemination.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">Eligible national and international researchers and experts participate in the implementation of the project activities, in compliance with the Vietnamese regulations in force. Recruited service providers must carry out the signed contracts in compliance with the quality and deadline requirements of these contracts.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">AFD will cooperate closely with the ministries and departments concerned and with the DCC during the implementation of the project. It will also ensure cooperation with the various nongovernmental organizations working on related subjects in order to harmonize methods and give additional leverage to the work undertaken in the framework of Gemme VN. </p>

		<p class="longtext">The goal of WP1 is threefold: build a comprehensive set of climate related variables in the past for Vietnam over the long run; provide with a probabilistic set of spatialized temperature, precipitation, extreme events scenarios, salinity intrusion scenarios, … with a high spatial resolution over Vietnamese territory for the 21st century; finally play a coordination role with the empirical studies conducted in WP2, WP3, and WP4 as well as with the macro analysis in WP5 for all climate related questions. </p>
		<img src="https://gemmes-project.github.io/gemmes_vn/assets/img/wp1_graph.png">
		<p class="longtext">In order to provide the probabilistic set of spatialized temperature, precipitation, extreme events scenarios, ... over Vietnam for the 21st century, the method applied will follow the study of Hsiang et al. (2017), by using a two-level technique. First, probabilistic global temperature projections will be obtained from global climate models (GCMs) forced by the different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). These projections are used to weight the spatialized results of the temperature and precipitation projections of a set of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). This technique, called pattern scaling, makes it possible to obtain "projection equivalents" even in portions of the global projections that are not represented by the existing GCMs. The recently available results of the CMIP6 inter comparison project will also be used to update climate projections. Spatially detailed probability distributions of temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables of interest are obtained using this method. Beside, WP1 may also use the 6-hourly to monthly outputs of the CORDEX network (Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment) for comparing with the results from the probabilistic method. From the obtained daily data (such as rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures), the Climate Extreme Indices will be estimated for assessing extreme events. The temporal resolution required for assessing impacts is often less than one month so that the availability of daily estimates (a priori in line with observed historical variabilities) will enable better assessment the economic impact on agriculture, for example.</p>

	<h2 class="wp">Work package n°2 - ECO </h2>
	<img src="https://gemmes-project.github.io/gemmes_vn/assets/img/WP2_main.jpg">
	<p class="chapo">WP2 focuses on an empirical analysis of past economic impacts of climate in Vietnam. This will allow us to evaluate response functions of specific impacts (and adaptation strategies) due to variations in temperature and precipitation (as well as other environmental variables, such as extreme events or sea-level rise) on major economic sectors of the Vietnamese economy such as agriculture (among which rice production, aquaculture, …), energy (both demand and supply), the informal sector, as well as the impact of extreme events on the stock of capital (infrastructure). In coordination with WP1, this package will also have the goal to project these response functions into the future, considering the relevant uncertainties in future climate. </p><span class="dots"></span>
	<div class="more" style="display: none;">
	

			
		<p class="longtext">Each one of the economic criteria selected as relevant for the study of the impacts of climate change in Vietnam can be evaluated in this way as long as the relevant data are available. A first step will be to take stock of the existing studies on the climate impacts on economic sectors in Vietnam through specific meta-analysis. The scientific standards of existing studies (spatial and social representation of the population surveyed, length of the time series, etc.) will be assessed in order to select some of the best research to include as inputs of the project. We then plan an extensive use of Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey and the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey, Enterprise Surveys, Agricultural Censuses, … with the adjunction of sector specific databases coming from public Vietnamese institutions to better illustrate adaptation strategies. In special cases, we also intend to use night-time lights as a proxy for GDP impacts of extreme events as well as the informal sector. Econometric methods will vary depending on the sector studied. But they all amount to build probability distributions of the specific impact, conditioned to the values of the climate variables. They can then be used to project spatial-detailed probabilistic scenarios of climate impacts given by the CLIMATO package, so that these empirical studies already give a thorough sectoral assessment of future climate impacts and adaptation strategies. These simulations will also serve as exogenous inputs to the macroeconomic model built in WP5. </p>

		<h4>Land Use Policy, Adaptation to Climate Change, and Aggregate Productivity in the Mekong Delta</h4>
		<h5>Author : Kien Le and co-authors</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> The Mekong Delta, also known as Vietnam’s rice bowl, is particularly vulnerable to saline intrusion from rising sea level and increasing temperature. Such climatic impacts have greatly affected rice production in the region because of the high demand for freshwater. To ensure the living standards, it is crucial for farmers to effectively cope with the impacts of climate change on the local ecosystems. One possible adaptation practice is to switch from rice cultivation that is freshwater-intensive to the production of other crops which demands less freshwater. However, the majority of agricultural land in the region is subject to the Rice Land Designation Policy (RLDP) that requires land be devoted to rice production only. In this study, we quantify the effects of RLDP on aggregate productivity where the policy misallocates farmers’ optimal crop choices in coping with the impacts of climate change. We do so by constructing a spatial equilibrium model featuring heterogeneous agents with endogenous production and occupational choices. The main findings suggest that RLDP could cost the Mekong Delta 5% of its GDP annually if no action was taken by the government.</p>
		<h4>Barriers to Effective Climate Change Mitigation: The Case of Vietnam’s Land Tenure</h4>
		<h5>Author : Kien Le and co-authors</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> Vietnam’s agricultural sector has been decentralized since the enactment of the Directive No.10 of 1988 (Khoán 10) that abolished collective farming and allocated agricultural land to households. As a result, farmers were allowed to make their own decisions on the sale of outputs and the uses of inputs, offering a significant incentive for production. However, land tenure was only secured for 10-15 years. The reason is that the allocated lands remain the property of all Vietnamese and managed by the government. With rising threats to freshwater, temperature, and rainfall levels, such tenure regimes limit farmers’ adoption of agricultural technologies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The reason is that the cost of adoption is high while farmers are still subject to the risk of expropriation upon the expiry of the tenure. In this study, we quantify the aggregate effect of Vietnam’s land tenure system where farmers are disincentivized to adopt technologies in coping with the impacts of climate change. We do so by building a dynamic multi-sector model featuring heterogeneous agents with endogenous technology adoption. The main findings suggest that the current tenure system could account for 5% loss annually in agricultural productivity during the period of 2000-2015. </p>

		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper evaluates the impact of uncertain and recurring climate conditions on marine capture fisheries production of coastal provinces in Vietnam. Since fishing efforts and weather indicators in a province can affect fishing yield of nearby provinces, we use the spatial Durbin model to capture the spatial dependence. We find that a province’s capture fisheries would decline if the average capture of its neighbouring provinces increased. The mean and range of daily temperature and maximum wind speed had spillover effects on adjacent provinces. An interesting result is that as a storm hit  a province, its capture was unchanged but its neighbors saw a decrease in their fish catch. </p>

		<p class="longtext">SOCIO provides comprehensive assessments to the effects of climate change on major social aspects of the Vietnamese society such as inequalities, migration, labor productivity, health, demography, nutrition impacts. These assessments are scientific rigor. SOCIO’s researchers employ cutting edge applied econometrics approach and large sample surveys and administrative data to provide robust and unbiased empirical evidences. Structural approach is used in some papers to better understand not only the effects but also mechanisms. This is important to identify the solutions to tackle the issues. In addition, spatial dynamic models are also used to examine regional divergences. Large sample surveys such as labor force survey, population change survey, Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey, Censuses 1999, 2009 allow us to provide insightful empirical analyses that previous studies were not able to capture. Firm-level administrate data support us analyzing firm-behaviors to adjust labor structure when facing with changes in temperature and precipitations. More importantly, SOCIO not only provides impact evaluation evidences but also provides scenarios-based projections. SOCIO also develops policy recommendation to adapt with climate change.</p>

		<h4>The labor productivity impacts of climate change: Evidence from Vietnamese firm level data </h4>
		<h5>Authors: Manh-Hung Nguyen and Toan Nguyen</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> In this study we develop a method to estimate the short- and long-term effects of climate change on labor productivity and hence the impact on production in a framework of multidimensional productivity using labor force survey and firm level data. To tackle the endogeneity problem between labor productivity (which is not observed by the econometrician) and labor costs, we adapt the previous methods of estimating production function ( Olley-Pakes (1996),Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), Ackerberg et al(2015), Doraszelski and Jaumandreu (2018), Gandhi et al (2019)) by relying on a profit maximization to generate a relationship between the unobserved productivity shocks and observable inputs and climate externalities. Labor productivity shocks are assumed to follow first order Markov processes and realized after the firm decide the amount of labor inputs. In the short run, firm observes the current labor levels and productivity shocks, then adjust static labor structure in profit-maximizing producer. When labor productivity shocks are affected by climate change, firm is uncertain about the future labor augmenting productivity. Therefore, labor adjustment behavior is a conditional probability on labor productivity shocks, adaptive costs, prices of inputs and other externality such as: variation of climate, extreme weather and natural disasters. This propensity score is estimated by a semiparametric Kernel regression (Robinson (1988)). In the long-run impact, we use a dynamic model of the firm to estimate the Total Factor Productivity and output to capture the endogeneity of the entry for more productive and the exist of less productive firms. To achieve this goal, we combine labor force survey, firm level data, and weather station data and decompose the meteorological variables into long-run trends and weather shocks.</p>
		<h4>Migration and firms productivity under climate shocks:Evidence from Vietnamese firm-level data</h4>
		<h5>Authors: Manh-Hung Nguyen and Toan Nguyen</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper, we quantify the effect of climate change on rural-urban migration. Moreover, we evaluate the effect of these migration flows on labor market outcomes urban workers along regional / sectoral / occupational dimension. We develop a quantitative dynamic spatial equilibrium model of regions and jobs over time to understand and quantify the heterogeneous labor market effects resulting from internal migration. The model provides a theoretical framework that focuses on the role of firms (through firm productivity channel) in responding to internal migration. Parameters of the model will be informed by, and predictions of the model compared to, empirical analysis of large sample data of both internal migration and firms. The model explicitly recognizes the role in the labor market of both supply side (workers) and demand side (firms) adjustments. We also look at the impact of internal migration on matching issues between supply and demand in labor market. Migrant workers with given skillsets and ability might have comparative advantages/disadvantages to find jobs in some sectors/industry/regions. In addition, migrants to urban regions due to climate change tend to have low skills. As a result, some groups of urban workers with complementary skills/ability are better off, while others might be worse-off due to competition from migrant workers. Therefore, identifying the impact of internal migration and the role of firms across regional/sectoral/occupational dimension is important. We will empirically estimate the predictions generated from the proposed framework using large scale datasets population change survey 1998-2019, Enterprise Survey 2000-2018, and labor force survey 2000-2018. The population change survey comprises of 330 thousand household each year and provides detail migration information both origin and destination. Meanwhile, the Enterprise Survey is conducted annually and have detailed information on firm characteristics. We merge these data with labor force survey to have information on labor market outcomes of urbane workers. The Labor Force Survey contains about 1 million individuals and has rich information on jobs and wages at individual level.</p>
		<h4>Climatic Shocks and Adult Health: Evidence from Vietnam</h4>
		<h5>Authors:  Lan Anh Nguyen, Manh-Hung Nguyen and My Nguyen</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> This study investigates the extent to which contemporaneous rainfall and temperature shocks influence health outcomes of Vietnamese adults. Adult health outcomes are drawn from the Thailand Vietnam Socio Economic Panel (TVSEP). Monthly mean air temperature and total rainfall are collected from records of local land based stations. Rainfall and temperature shocks in the individual’s residence district are measured as the annual deviations from the historical norms. Our empirical model exploits the plausibly exogenous deviations of rainfall and temperature from the historical norms combined with an individual fixed effects framework. The within-individual comparison approach will absorb the time-constant individual characteristics that cannot be observed, thus lending further support to the internal validity of the estimates. Our main objective is to explore the impacts of climatic shocks on adult health. The data allow us to examine whether recent exposure to higher rainfall and temperature (relative to normal local average) conditions individuals' current self-reported health, nutrition status proxied by food consumption, expenditure on health care, and other individual health outcomes such as body weight, current health relative to prior years (one and five years ago), whether the individual currently has any illnesses, whether the individual seeks treatment, and the number of working weeks lost due to illnesses.  </p>

	<img src="https://gemmes-project.github.io/gemmes_vn/assets/img/train.jpg">
	<p class="chapo">This central macroeconomic model gives an exhaustive view of the socio-economic impacts of climate change in Vietnam and adaptation strategy, by aggregating the different sectoral or region-specific analysis as well as the climate projections of other packages. We present interactive versions of this first stock-flow coherent model of the Vietnamese economy coupled with climate impacts and adaptation prospective scenarios.</p><span class="dots"></span>
	<div class="more" style="display: none;">
	

			
		<p class="longtext">We first build a stock-flow coherent macroeconomic model of the Vietnames economy in two steps: a five institutional sectors model (households, firms, financial sector, government and the rest of the world), which we estimate and validate based on existing data and use to assess the impacts of extreme climate events ; a disaggregation of the productive sector allowing us to integrate the impacts and adaptation strategies at different sectoral and regional levels, which we use to develop prospective scenarios to 2050.  It is the first stock-flow coherent model of the Vietnamese economy. </p>
		<p class="longtext">Government institutions, research institutes and universities in Vietnam are using different types of macroeconomic models for modelling the Vietnamese economy and forecasting as well as policy analysis: structural macro-econometric models, time series-based models and input-output models. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models constitute the main existing accounting-based macroeconomic modelling approach in Vietnam. The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) used in these CGE models combine the Input-Output (I-O) table, the Vietnam Households Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) and other macroeconomic data from the government as well as international sources such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. However, the financial sector is not modelled there mainly due to the lack of availability of financial data, but also to the more fundamental hypothesis that the structure of the balance sheet of agents do not matter for the overall dynamics of the system. We consider on the contrary that balance sheets matter in the long run as well, and they are key to highlight adaptation financing strategies. </p>
		<p class="longtext">This page will detail the structure of the different versions of the macroeconomic model used in the GEMMES Vietnam project. It will explain the way macroeconomic data have been gathered, transformed in line with the economic accounts and how dynamic behaviors of  agents have been estimated. It will show how the model is able to reproduce past time series, and how it forecast future dynamics of the Vietnamese economy. Finally it will present the results in an interactive way for the incorporation of sectoral and regional impact and adaptation assessments.  </p>

	<h3 class="wptitle">A qualitative approach to local responses to climate change in Vietnam</h3>
	
	<img src="https://gemmes-project.github.io/gemmes_vn/assets/img/adapto.JPG">
	<p class="chapo"> « Adapto » is a social sciences package that address the question of local responses to climate change through a qualitative approach. We study the social, political, institutional and spatial issues that shape adaptation strategies to environmental hazards and climate change at the local level.  </p><span class="dots"></span>
	<div class="more" style="display: none;">
	

			
		<p class="longtext">That study includes three component: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>A study of perceptions of environmental change and of the role of social networks to cope with environmental hazards and to adapt to climate change</li>
			<li>A study of the effective modalities of the implementation of adaptation policies</li>
			<li>A seminar of environmental history of Vietnam</li>
		</ol> 
		<p class="longtext">Our hypothesis is that these "factors" (perceptions, social capital, policies & institutional framework and past experience), still under-studied through a qualitative approach in Vietnam, strongly determine local responses and adaptations to climate change.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">Our approach is based in fieldwork, i.e. micro-localized and in-depth qualitative surveys. Classical tools from qualitative method, such as immersion in local life, direct observation of practices, open interviews, informal talks, and local written sources are used and combined to collect data and generate analysis. A set of localized case studies allow us to gather tangible information about people practices and discourses.   </p>
		<p class="longtext">On this basis, we conduct a series of field studies with populations affected by new and recurring climatic or environmental events in different localities in the North and South of Vietnam (Lào Cai, Cân Thơ, Bến Tre). For each environmental or climatic event we address the following issue:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Trace its course;</li>
			<li>Study how the event was perceived and experienced by local actors;</li>
			<li>Understand their effects on agrarian (or economic) systems;</li>
			<li>Address the responses and coping strategies.</li>
		</ul>  
		<p class="longtext">From the empirical diversity of situations and practices we will built an inductive typology of responses and adaptations. We will then identify the main factors that influence the type of response and analyze the importance of perceptions, social networks and institutional aspects within all that factors. </p>
		<p class="longtext">In addition to this conjunctural perspective (by given climatic events), we will broaden the focus to take into account the structural transformations of socio-ecosystems and the way populations apprehend them. The objective of this two-level approach (short term/long term) is to place specific events and response within a long period of time in order to determine, in fine, to what extent local adaptation strategies are completely new, updates of past experiences, or a hybrid between the two. </p>
		<p class="longtext">Concerning the study of climate change adaptation policies and environmental governance, the approach is based on a policy analysis and monitoring. It articulates different scales: the discourse at the national level, the way in which this translates into regional actions and relations with donors at this level, and finally the localized effects (neighborhood scale) of these actions.  To do this, we propose to monitor adaptation projects financed by international donors (including the AFD) in order to report on the types of narratives mobilized, the trade-offs made and the tensions that may emerge in the process of elaborating public action.</p>
