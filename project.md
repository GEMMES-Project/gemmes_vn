<p class="longtext">This research project is part of the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding signed in March 2018 between the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Director General of the French Development Agency. This memorandum, which covers various topics related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, has as a priority goal the study of the various dimensions of climate damage in Viet Nam and the assessment of adaptation strategies. The present project is the main concretization of this, materialized in a new Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 2019. In addition, this project provides significant support to Vietnamese research and the production of high-level research results that will support the public policy dialogue of the Agence Française de Développement with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. </p>

		<p class="longtext">In order to provide the probabilistic set of spatialized temperature, precipitation, extreme events scenarios, ... over Vietnam for the 21st century, the method applied will follow the study of Hsiang et al. (2017), by using a two-level technique. First, probabilistic global temperature projections will be obtained from global climate models (GCMs) forced by the different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). These projections are used to weight the spatialized results of the temperature and precipitation projections of a set of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). This technique, called pattern scaling, makes it possible to obtain "projection equivalents" even in portions of the global projections that are not represented by the existing GCMs. The recently available results of the CMIP6 inter comparison project will also be used to update climate projections. Spatially detailed probability distributions of temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables of interest are obtained using this method. Beside, WP1 may also use the 6-hourly to monthly outputs of the CORDEX network (Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment) for comparing with the results from the probabilistic method. From the obtained daily data (such as rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures), the Climate Extreme Indices will be estimated for assessing extreme events. The temporal resolution required for assessing impacts is often less than one month so that the availability of daily estimates (a priori in line with observed historical variabilities) will enable better assessment the economic impact on agriculture, for example.</p>

	<h2 class="wp">Work package n°2 - ECO </h2>

	<p class="chapo">WP2 focuses on an empirical analysis of past economic impacts of climate in Vietnam. This will allow us to evaluate response functions of specific impacts (and adaptation strategies) due to variations in temperature and precipitation (as well as other environmental variables, such as extreme events or sea-level rise) on major economic sectors of the Vietnamese economy such as agriculture (among which rice production, aquaculture, …), energy (both demand and supply), the informal sector, as well as the impact of extreme events on the stock of capital (infrastructure). In coordination with WP1, this package will also have the goal to project these response functions into the future, considering the relevant uncertainties in future climate. </p><span class="dots"></span>

		<p class="longtext">Each one of the economic criteria selected as relevant for the study of the impacts of climate change in Vietnam can be evaluated in this way as long as the relevant data are available. A first step will be to take stock of the existing studies on the climate impacts on economic sectors in Vietnam through specific meta-analysis. The scientific standards of existing studies (spatial and social representation of the population surveyed, length of the time series, etc.) will be assessed in order to select some of the best research to include as inputs of the project. We then plan an extensive use of Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey and the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey, Enterprise Surveys, Agricultural Censuses, … with the adjunction of sector specific databases coming from public Vietnamese institutions to better illustrate adaptation strategies. In special cases, we also intend to use night-time lights as a proxy for GDP impacts of extreme events as well as the informal sector. Econometric methods will vary depending on the sector studied. But they all amount to build probability distributions of the specific impact, conditioned to the values of the climate variables. They can then be used to project spatial-detailed probabilistic scenarios of climate impacts given by the CLIMATO package, so that these empirical studies already give a thorough sectoral assessment of future climate impacts and adaptation strategies. These simulations will also serve as exogenous inputs to the macroeconomic model built in WP5. </p>

		<h4>Land Use Policy, Adaptation to Climate Change, and Aggregate Productivity in the Mekong Delta</h4>
		<h5>Author : Kien Le and co-authors</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> The Mekong Delta, also known as Vietnam’s rice bowl, is particularly vulnerable to saline intrusion from rising sea level and increasing temperature. Such climatic impacts have greatly affected rice production in the region because of the high demand for freshwater. To ensure the living standards, it is crucial for farmers to effectively cope with the impacts of climate change on the local ecosystems. One possible adaptation practice is to switch from rice cultivation that is freshwater-intensive to the production of other crops which demands less freshwater. However, the majority of agricultural land in the region is subject to the Rice Land Designation Policy (RLDP) that requires land be devoted to rice production only. In this study, we quantify the effects of RLDP on aggregate productivity where the policy misallocates farmers’ optimal crop choices in coping with the impacts of climate change. We do so by constructing a spatial equilibrium model featuring heterogeneous agents with endogenous production and occupational choices. The main findings suggest that RLDP could cost the Mekong Delta 5% of its GDP annually if no action was taken by the government.</p>
		<h4>Barriers to Effective Climate Change Mitigation: The Case of Vietnam’s Land Tenure</h4>
		<h5>Author : Kien Le and co-authors</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> Vietnam’s agricultural sector has been decentralized since the enactment of the Directive No.10 of 1988 (Khoán 10) that abolished collective farming and allocated agricultural land to households. As a result, farmers were allowed to make their own decisions on the sale of outputs and the uses of inputs, offering a significant incentive for production. However, land tenure was only secured for 10-15 years. The reason is that the allocated lands remain the property of all Vietnamese and managed by the government. With rising threats to freshwater, temperature, and rainfall levels, such tenure regimes limit farmers’ adoption of agricultural technologies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The reason is that the cost of adoption is high while farmers are still subject to the risk of expropriation upon the expiry of the tenure. In this study, we quantify the aggregate effect of Vietnam’s land tenure system where farmers are disincentivized to adopt technologies in coping with the impacts of climate change. We do so by building a dynamic multi-sector model featuring heterogeneous agents with endogenous technology adoption. The main findings suggest that the current tenure system could account for 5% loss annually in agricultural productivity during the period of 2000-2015. </p>
		<h4>The spatial impact of natural disasters on fishery in Vietnam</h4>
		<h5>Authors: Chon Le Van, Lan-Anh Nguyen, Manh-Hung Nguyen</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper evaluates the impact of uncertain and recurring climate conditions on marine capture fisheries production of coastal provinces in Vietnam. Since fishing efforts and weather indicators in a province can affect fishing yield of nearby provinces, we use the spatial Durbin model to capture the spatial dependence. We find that a province’s capture fisheries would decline if the average capture of its neighbouring provinces increased. The mean and range of daily temperature and maximum wind speed had spillover effects on adjacent provinces. An interesting result is that as a storm hit  a province, its capture was unchanged but its neighbors saw a decrease in their fish catch. </p>

		<p class="longtext">SOCIO provides comprehensive assessments to the effects of climate change on major social aspects of the Vietnamese society such as inequalities, migration, labor productivity, health, demography, nutrition impacts. These assessments are scientific rigor. SOCIO’s researchers employ cutting edge applied econometrics approach and large sample surveys and administrative data to provide robust and unbiased empirical evidences. Structural approach is used in some papers to better understand not only the effects but also mechanisms. This is important to identify the solutions to tackle the issues. In addition, spatial dynamic models are also used to examine regional divergences. Large sample surveys such as labor force survey, population change survey, Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey, Censuses 1999, 2009 allow us to provide insightful empirical analyses that previous studies were not able to capture. Firm-level administrate data support us analyzing firm-behaviors to adjust labor structure when facing with changes in temperature and precipitations. More importantly, SOCIO not only provides impact evaluation evidences but also provides scenarios-based projections. SOCIO also develops policy recommendation to adapt with climate change.</p>

		<h4>The labor productivity impacts of climate change: Evidence from Vietnamese firm level data </h4>
		<h5>Authors: Manh-Hung Nguyen and Toan Nguyen</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> In this study we develop a method to estimate the short- and long-term effects of climate change on labor productivity and hence the impact on production in a framework of multidimensional productivity using labor force survey and firm level data. To tackle the endogeneity problem between labor productivity (which is not observed by the econometrician) and labor costs, we adapt the previous methods of estimating production function ( Olley-Pakes (1996),Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), Ackerberg et al(2015), Doraszelski and Jaumandreu (2018), Gandhi et al (2019)) by relying on a profit maximization to generate a relationship between the unobserved productivity shocks and observable inputs and climate externalities. Labor productivity shocks are assumed to follow first order Markov processes and realized after the firm decide the amount of labor inputs. In the short run, firm observes the current labor levels and productivity shocks, then adjust static labor structure in profit-maximizing producer. When labor productivity shocks are affected by climate change, firm is uncertain about the future labor augmenting productivity. Therefore, labor adjustment behavior is a conditional probability on labor productivity shocks, adaptive costs, prices of inputs and other externality such as: variation of climate, extreme weather and natural disasters. This propensity score is estimated by a semiparametric Kernel regression (Robinson (1988)). In the long-run impact, we use a dynamic model of the firm to estimate the Total Factor Productivity and output to capture the endogeneity of the entry for more productive and the exist of less productive firms. To achieve this goal, we combine labor force survey, firm level data, and weather station data and decompose the meteorological variables into long-run trends and weather shocks.</p>
		<h4>Migration and firms productivity under climate shocks:Evidence from Vietnamese firm-level data</h4>
		<h5>Authors: Manh-Hung Nguyen and Toan Nguyen</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper, we quantify the effect of climate change on rural-urban migration. Moreover, we evaluate the effect of these migration flows on labor market outcomes urban workers along regional / sectoral / occupational dimension. We develop a quantitative dynamic spatial equilibrium model of regions and jobs over time to understand and quantify the heterogeneous labor market effects resulting from internal migration. The model provides a theoretical framework that focuses on the role of firms (through firm productivity channel) in responding to internal migration. Parameters of the model will be informed by, and predictions of the model compared to, empirical analysis of large sample data of both internal migration and firms. The model explicitly recognizes the role in the labor market of both supply side (workers) and demand side (firms) adjustments. We also look at the impact of internal migration on matching issues between supply and demand in labor market. Migrant workers with given skillsets and ability might have comparative advantages/disadvantages to find jobs in some sectors/industry/regions. In addition, migrants to urban regions due to climate change tend to have low skills. As a result, some groups of urban workers with complementary skills/ability are better off, while others might be worse-off due to competition from migrant workers. Therefore, identifying the impact of internal migration and the role of firms across regional/sectoral/occupational dimension is important. We will empirically estimate the predictions generated from the proposed framework using large scale datasets population change survey 1998-2019, Enterprise Survey 2000-2018, and labor force survey 2000-2018. The population change survey comprises of 330 thousand household each year and provides detail migration information both origin and destination. Meanwhile, the Enterprise Survey is conducted annually and have detailed information on firm characteristics. We merge these data with labor force survey to have information on labor market outcomes of urbane workers. The Labor Force Survey contains about 1 million individuals and has rich information on jobs and wages at individual level.</p>
		<h4>Climatic Shocks and Adult Health: Evidence from Vietnam</h4>
		<h5>Authors:  Lan Anh Nguyen, Manh-Hung Nguyen and My Nguyen</h5>
		<p class="chapo"><b>Abstract:</b> This study investigates the extent to which contemporaneous rainfall and temperature shocks influence health outcomes of Vietnamese adults. Adult health outcomes are drawn from the Thailand Vietnam Socio Economic Panel (TVSEP). Monthly mean air temperature and total rainfall are collected from records of local land based stations. Rainfall and temperature shocks in the individual’s residence district are measured as the annual deviations from the historical norms. Our empirical model exploits the plausibly exogenous deviations of rainfall and temperature from the historical norms combined with an individual fixed effects framework. The within-individual comparison approach will absorb the time-constant individual characteristics that cannot be observed, thus lending further support to the internal validity of the estimates. Our main objective is to explore the impacts of climatic shocks on adult health. The data allow us to examine whether recent exposure to higher rainfall and temperature (relative to normal local average) conditions individuals' current self-reported health, nutrition status proxied by food consumption, expenditure on health care, and other individual health outcomes such as body weight, current health relative to prior years (one and five years ago), whether the individual currently has any illnesses, whether the individual seeks treatment, and the number of working weeks lost due to illnesses.  </p>

We present interactive versions of this first stock-flow coherent model of the Vietnamese economy coupled with climate impacts and adaptation prospective scenarios.</p><span class="dots"></span>

		<p class="longtext">We first build a stock-flow coherent macroeconomic model of the Vietnames economy in two steps: a five institutional sectors model (households, firms, financial sector, government and the rest of the world), which we estimate and validate based on existing data and use to assess the impacts of extreme climate events ; a disaggregation of the productive sector allowing us to integrate the impacts and adaptation strategies at different sectoral and regional levels, which we use to develop prospective scenarios to 2050.  It is the first stock-flow coherent model of the Vietnamese economy. </p>
		<p class="longtext">Government institutions, research institutes and universities in Vietnam are using different types of macroeconomic models for modelling the Vietnamese economy and forecasting as well as policy analysis: structural macro-econometric models, time series-based models and input-output models. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models constitute the main existing accounting-based macroeconomic modelling approach in Vietnam. The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) used in these CGE models combine the Input-Output (I-O) table, the Vietnam Households Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) and other macroeconomic data from the government as well as international sources such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. However, the financial sector is not modelled there mainly due to the lack of availability of financial data, but also to the more fundamental hypothesis that the structure of the balance sheet of agents do not matter for the overall dynamics of the system. We consider on the contrary that balance sheets matter in the long run as well, and they are key to highlight adaptation financing strategies. </p>
		<p class="longtext">This page will detail the structure of the different versions of the macroeconomic model used in the GEMMES Vietnam project. It will explain the way macroeconomic data have been gathered, transformed in line with the economic accounts and how dynamic behaviors of  agents have been estimated. It will show how the model is able to reproduce past time series, and how it forecast future dynamics of the Vietnamese economy. Finally it will present the results in an interactive way for the incorporation of sectoral and regional impact and adaptation assessments.  </p>

	<h3 class="wptitle">A qualitative approach to local responses to climate change in Vietnam</h3>

	<p class="chapo"> « Adapto » is a social sciences package that address the question of local responses to climate change through a qualitative approach. We study the social, political, institutional and spatial issues that shape adaptation strategies to environmental hazards and climate change at the local level.  </p><span class="dots"></span>
	<div class="more" style="display: none;">
	<img src="https://gohu00.github.io/gemmes_vn/assets/img/adapto.JPG">

			
		<p class="longtext">That study includes three component: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>A study of perceptions of environmental change and of the role of social networks to cope with environmental hazards and to adapt to climate change</li>
			<li>A study of the effective modalities of the implementation of adaptation policies</li>
			<li>A seminar of environmental history of Vietnam</li>
		</ol> 
		<p class="longtext">Our hypothesis is that these "factors" (perceptions, social capital, policies & institutional framework and past experience), still under-studied through a qualitative approach in Vietnam, strongly determine local responses and adaptations to climate change.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">Our approach is based in fieldwork, i.e. micro-localized and in-depth qualitative surveys. Classical tools from qualitative method, such as immersion in local life, direct observation of practices, open interviews, informal talks, and local written sources are used and combined to collect data and generate analysis. A set of localized case studies allow us to gather tangible information about people practices and discourses.   </p>
		<p class="longtext">On this basis, we conduct a series of field studies with populations affected by new and recurring climatic or environmental events in different localities in the North and South of Vietnam (Lào Cai, Cân Thơ, Bến Tre). For each environmental or climatic event we address the following issue:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Trace its course;</li>
			<li>Study how the event was perceived and experienced by local actors;</li>
			<li>Understand their effects on agrarian (or economic) systems;</li>
			<li>Address the responses and coping strategies.</li>
		</ul>  
		<p class="longtext">From the empirical diversity of situations and practices we will built an inductive typology of responses and adaptations. We will then identify the main factors that influence the type of response and analyze the importance of perceptions, social networks and institutional aspects within all that factors. </p>
		<p class="longtext">In addition to this conjunctural perspective (by given climatic events), we will broaden the focus to take into account the structural transformations of socio-ecosystems and the way populations apprehend them. The objective of this two-level approach (short term/long term) is to place specific events and response within a long period of time in order to determine, in fine, to what extent local adaptation strategies are completely new, updates of past experiences, or a hybrid between the two. </p>
		<p class="longtext">Concerning the study of climate change adaptation policies and environmental governance, the approach is based on a policy analysis and monitoring. It articulates different scales: the discourse at the national level, the way in which this translates into regional actions and relations with donors at this level, and finally the localized effects (neighborhood scale) of these actions.  To do this, we propose to monitor adaptation projects financed by international donors (including the AFD) in order to report on the types of narratives mobilized, the trade-offs made and the tensions that may emerge in the process of elaborating public action.</p>
