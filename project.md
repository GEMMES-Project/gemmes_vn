		<p class="longtext">In order to provide the probabilistic set of spatialized temperature, precipitation, extreme events scenarios, ... over Vietnam for the 21st century, the method applied will follow the study of Hsiang et al. (2017), by using a two-level technique. First, probabilistic global temperature projections will be obtained from global climate models (GCMs) forced by the different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). These projections are used to weight the spatialized results of the temperature and precipitation projections of a set of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). This technique, called pattern scaling, makes it possible to obtain "projection equivalents" even in portions of the global projections that are not represented by the existing GCMs. The recently available results of the CMIP6 inter comparison project will also be used to update climate projections. Spatially detailed probability distributions of temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables of interest are obtained using this method. Beside, WP1 may also use the 6-hourly to monthly outputs of the CORDEX network (Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment) for comparing with the results from the probabilistic method. From the obtained daily data (such as rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures), the Climate Extreme Indices will be estimated for assessing extreme events. The temporal resolution required for assessing impacts is often less than one month so that the availability of daily estimates (a priori in line with observed historical variabilities) will enable better assessment the economic impact on agriculture, for example.</p>

	<h2 class="wp">Work package n°2 - ECO </h2>

	<p class="chapo">WP2 focuses on an empirical analysis of past economic impacts of climate in Vietnam. This will allow us to evaluate response functions of specific impacts (and adaptation strategies) due to variations in temperature and precipitation (as well as other environmental variables, such as extreme events or sea-level rise) on major economic sectors of the Vietnamese economy such as agriculture (among which rice production, aquaculture, …), energy (both demand and supply), the informal sector, as well as the impact of extreme events on the stock of capital (infrastructure). In coordination with WP1, this package will also have the goal to project these response functions into the future, considering the relevant uncertainties in future climate. </p><span class="dots"></span>

		<p class="longtext">Each one of the economic criteria selected as relevant for the study of the impacts of climate change in Vietnam can be evaluated in this way as long as the relevant data are available. A first step will be to take stock of the existing studies on the climate impacts on economic sectors in Vietnam through specific meta-analysis. The scientific standards of existing studies (spatial and social representation of the population surveyed, length of the time series, etc.) will be assessed in order to select some of the best research to include as inputs of the project. We then plan an extensive use of Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey and the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey, Enterprise Surveys, Agricultural Censuses, … with the adjunction of sector specific databases coming from public Vietnamese institutions to better illustrate adaptation strategies. In special cases, we also intend to use night-time lights as a proxy for GDP impacts of extreme events as well as the informal sector. Econometric methods will vary depending on the sector studied. But they all amount to build probability distributions of the specific impact, conditioned to the values of the climate variables. They can then be used to project spatial-detailed probabilistic scenarios of climate impacts given by the CLIMATO package, so that these empirical studies already give a thorough sectoral assessment of future climate impacts and adaptation strategies. These simulations will also serve as exogenous inputs to the macroeconomic model built in WP5. </p>

	<p class="chapo">The aims of SOCIO is to evaluate the effects of climate change and natural disasters on social economics aspects such as: labor productivity, migration, human capital. This work package also examines causal impacts of climate change and extreme weather on nutrition and public health.  </p><span class="dots"></span>

		<p class="longtext">SOCIO provides comprehensive assessments to the effects of climate change on major social aspects of the Vietnamese society such as inequalities, migration, labor productivity, health, demography, nutrition impacts. These assessments are scientific rigor. SOCIO’s researchers employ cutting edge applied econometrics approach and large sample surveys and administrative data to provide robust and unbiased empirical evidences. Structural approach is used in some papers to better understand not only the effects but also mechanisms. This is important to identify the solutions to tackle the issues. In addition, spatial dynamic models are also used to examine regional divergences. Large sample surveys such as labor force survey, population change survey, Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey, Censuses 1999, 2009 allow us to provide insightful empirical analyses that previous studies were not able to capture. Firm-level administrate data support us analyzing firm-behaviors to adjust labor structure when facing with changes in temperature and precipitations. More importantly, SOCIO not only provides impact evaluation evidences but also provides scenarios-based projections. SOCIO also develops policy recommendation to adapt with climate change.</p>

	<h3 class="wptitle">Macroeconomic assessment of climate damages and adaptation strategies</h3>

	<p class="chapo">This central macroeconomic model gives an exhaustive view of the socio-economic impacts of climate change in Vietnam and adaptation strategy, by aggregating the different sectoral or region-specific analysis as well as the climate projections of other packages. We present interactive versions of this first stock-flow coherent model of the Vietnamese economy coupled with climate impacts and adaptation prospective scenarios.</p><span class="dots"></span>
	<div class="more" style="display: none;">
	<img src="https://gohu00.github.io/gemmes_vn/assets/img/train.jpg">

			
		<p class="longtext">We first build a stock-flow coherent macroeconomic model of the Vietnames economy in two steps: a five institutional sectors model (households, firms, financial sector, government and the rest of the world), which we estimate and validate based on existing data and use to assess the impacts of extreme climate events ; a disaggregation of the productive sector allowing us to integrate the impacts and adaptation strategies at different sectoral and regional levels, which we use to develop prospective scenarios to 2050.  It is the first stock-flow coherent model of the Vietnamese economy. </p>
		<p class="longtext">Government institutions, research institutes and universities in Vietnam are using different types of macroeconomic models for modelling the Vietnamese economy and forecasting as well as policy analysis: structural macro-econometric models, time series-based models and input-output models. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models constitute the main existing accounting-based macroeconomic modelling approach in Vietnam. The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) used in these CGE models combine the Input-Output (I-O) table, the Vietnam Households Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) and other macroeconomic data from the government as well as international sources such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. However, the financial sector is not modelled there mainly due to the lack of availability of financial data, but also to the more fundamental hypothesis that the structure of the balance sheet of agents do not matter for the overall dynamics of the system. We consider on the contrary that balance sheets matter in the long run as well, and they are key to highlight adaptation financing strategies. </p>
		<p class="longtext">This page will detail the structure of the different versions of the macroeconomic model used in the GEMMES Vietnam project. It will explain the way macroeconomic data have been gathered, transformed in line with the economic accounts and how dynamic behaviors of  agents have been estimated. It will show how the model is able to reproduce past time series, and how it forecast future dynamics of the Vietnamese economy. Finally it will present the results in an interactive way for the incorporation of sectoral and regional impact and adaptation assessments.  </p>

	<h2 class="wp">Work package n°6 - ADAPTO  </h2>
	<h3 class="wptitle">A qualitative approach to local responses to climate change in Vietnam</h3>

	<p class="chapo"> « Adapto » is a social sciences package that address the question of local responses to climate change through a qualitative approach. We study the social, political, institutional and spatial issues that shape adaptation strategies to environmental hazards and climate change at the local level.  </p><span class="dots"></span>
	<div class="more" style="display: none;">
	<img src="https://gohu00.github.io/gemmes_vn/assets/img/adapto.JPG">

			
		<p class="longtext">That study includes three component: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>A study of perceptions of environmental change and of the role of social networks to cope with environmental hazards and to adapt to climate change</li>
			<li>A study of the effective modalities of the implementation of adaptation policies</li>
			<li>A seminar of environmental history of Vietnam</li>
		</ol> 
		<p class="longtext">Our hypothesis is that these "factors" (perceptions, social capital, policies & institutional framework and past experience), still under-studied through a qualitative approach in Vietnam, strongly determine local responses and adaptations to climate change.  </p>
		<p class="longtext">Our approach is based in fieldwork, i.e. micro-localized and in-depth qualitative surveys. Classical tools from qualitative method, such as immersion in local life, direct observation of practices, open interviews, informal talks, and local written sources are used and combined to collect data and generate analysis. A set of localized case studies allow us to gather tangible information about people practices and discourses.   </p>
		<p class="longtext">On this basis, we conduct a series of field studies with populations affected by new and recurring climatic or environmental events in different localities in the North and South of Vietnam (Lào Cai, Cân Thơ, Bến Tre). For each environmental or climatic event we address the following issue:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Trace its course;</li>
			<li>Study how the event was perceived and experienced by local actors;</li>
			<li>Understand their effects on agrarian (or economic) systems;</li>
			<li>Address the responses and coping strategies.</li>
		</ul>  
		<p class="longtext">From the empirical diversity of situations and practices we will built an inductive typology of responses and adaptations. We will then identify the main factors that influence the type of response and analyze the importance of perceptions, social networks and institutional aspects within all that factors. </p>
		<p class="longtext">In addition to this conjunctural perspective (by given climatic events), we will broaden the focus to take into account the structural transformations of socio-ecosystems and the way populations apprehend them. The objective of this two-level approach (short term/long term) is to place specific events and response within a long period of time in order to determine, in fine, to what extent local adaptation strategies are completely new, updates of past experiences, or a hybrid between the two. </p>
		<p class="longtext">Concerning the study of climate change adaptation policies and environmental governance, the approach is based on a policy analysis and monitoring. It articulates different scales: the discourse at the national level, the way in which this translates into regional actions and relations with donors at this level, and finally the localized effects (neighborhood scale) of these actions.  To do this, we propose to monitor adaptation projects financed by international donors (including the AFD) in order to report on the types of narratives mobilized, the trade-offs made and the tensions that may emerge in the process of elaborating public action.</p>
