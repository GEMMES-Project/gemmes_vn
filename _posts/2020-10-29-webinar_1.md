## Description

High-resolution climate scenarios accounting for the different sources of uncertainties over future climate policies is a necessary first step to assess the socio-economic impacts of climate change by 2050. We will propose a new methodology to downscale the climate scenarios from the global climate models of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 modeling programs at a finer granularity over Vietnam. Specific scenarios of sea-level rise, subsidence and salinity intrusion have also been developed for the Mekong region. Finally, it is essential to be able to communicate widely around future climate scenarios and impacts, and we will thus discuss the core elements of a new platform showing dynamic maps of future climate impacts in Vietnam.
